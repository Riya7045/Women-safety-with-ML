# Women-safety-with-ML
A machine learning project aimed at enhancing womenâ€™s safety by analyzing data, detecting unsafe situations, and providing actionable insights. This project integrates machine learning algorithms, data visualization, and predictive analytics to help create safer environments.

## Features
Safety Prediction: Predicts the safety of a location based on various parameters such as crime rates, time of day, and environmental conditions.

Real-time Alerts: Sends alerts when potentially unsafe situations are identified.


Data Visualization: Interactive graphs and charts for analyzing trends in safety-related data.

Customizable: Modular design allows integration with additional datasets or applications like mobile apps.

## Dataset
The project uses data including:

Historical crime rates

Time and location details

People frequency

Availability of Bar and Police Station

## Technologies Used
Programming Language: Python

### Libraries:
Pandas: Data manipulation and analysis

Matplotlib & Seaborn: Data visualization

Scikit-learn: Machine learning models


## How It Works
Data Preprocessing:
Cleans and preprocesses the dataset for model training.

Model Training:
Uses machine learning algorithms (e.g., Random Forest, Logistic Regression) to train a safety prediction model.

Evaluation:
Validates the model using accuracy, precision, and recall metrics.

Visualization:
Generates interactive graphs for insights into safety trends.

Usage
Analyze Safety:
Run the application to check safety scores for specific locations or times.

Visualize Trends:
Use the data visualization tool to understand safety patterns over time.

Customize Alerts:
Modify thresholds in the configuration file to set custom alerts for your use case.
